# How to Launch

### Creating a Python Runtime Environment
    - In your command line, type python -m venv venv in the desired project folder. 
      (This will enable you to isolate your versions when working on multiple projects,
      by preventing the installation from being carried out at a global level.)
    - Activate your virtual environment by typing .\venv\scripts\activate on windows 
      and source venv/bin/activate on MacOS or linux.
    - You should see (venv) at the start of your folder paths.
    - Before closing your project or terminal, deactivate your virtual environment 
      by typing deactivate or more specifically .\venv\scripts\deactivate 
      or source venv/bin/deactivate
    - Remember to include your virtual environment folder, venv in your .gitignore file.
    

### Installing the Requirements.txt file 
    - While in an activate virtual environment, type pip install -r requirements.txt
    to install all packages for the project. 
    - To update/ export all installed packages to the requirements.txt file
     use the pip freeze > requirements.txt command.
     

### Finally, run your file 
    This will be updated when the initial set up is completed.
